# Doublet Detection Benchmark

This repository contains the code to generate the result in the paper 'Benchmarking computational doublet-detection methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data'.

## Code Description

1. overall_real_stability: This folder contains the code of detecting doublets in 16 real datasets by 11 doublet-detection methods (including two baseline methods). In addition, within each file there are functions to reproduce stability evaluation.
2. overall_sim: This folder contains the code of detecting doublets in synthetic datasets by 8 doublet-detection methods under various experimental conditions.
